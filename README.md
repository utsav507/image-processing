## fuzzy-logic-system
Implementation of a fuzzy logic image processing system.

## hough-transform-and-intensity-thresholding-methods
Hough Transform and Intensity Thresholding Methods.

## image-enhancement
Image enhancement in the spatial domain.

## ordered-dithering
Design and provide experimental results on the following halftoning technique: Ordered dithering.

## wavelets-multi-resolution-processing
Understand the 2D wavelet transform and use db1 to perform the 2D wavelet transform of the 
image to determine and locate all contaminated periodic noise. The experimental design must contain 
the verification of the fact that additive Gaussian noise to the spatial image data of a given variance 
level will remain the same variance level at each sub-band of the DWT of the image, and soft-thresholding 
method can reduce the noise level.
